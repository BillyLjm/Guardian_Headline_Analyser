Guardian-Analyser
=================
A web-page-based data analyser for the Guardian API.  
Parses headlines' words, articles dates & articles' sections.  
Written in HTML, PHP & JavaScript.  
Created as my final project for CS50x, Winter 2012.   

## How to Use:
1. Get Apache HTTP or any other similar programs.  
   If unfamiliar with installing Apache HTTP, google for tutorials on how to install it.  
	I used [this tutorial](http://lifeofageekadmin.com/how-install-apache-2-4-php-5-4-and-mysql-5-5-21-on-windows-7/) to install Apache HTTP on my windows computer.

2. Extract all the files in this repo to the directory which Apache HTTP reads from.  

3. Start Apache & go to "http://localhost" in your browser.  

4. Follow the instructions on the browser like you would with any other web app. 

5. Have Fun!
